							<h3>Do music streaming platforms solve the piracy problem?
</h3>
							<p>Whether or not artists are on-board with streaming services, it appears they're here to stay. In the paper "Download or stream? Steal or buy? Developing a typology of today's music consumer" published in the Journal of Consumer Behaviour, music experts Gary Sinclair and Todd Green revealed that music consumers, like ex-downloaders, were often conflicted when deciding to illegally download music. Streaming services provide a way for these users to eliminate the guilt they sometimes feel by not financially supporting the artists they like.

							<h3>How The Deal Is Made
</h3>
							<p>Music-streaming platforms don't openly discuss label deals. We only hear about them when artists, labels or publishers complain. When setting them up, streaming platforms like Apple Music or Amazon Prime Music approach the label with their plans, negotiating until both parties are satisfied. The length of the contracts varies from label to label, but most are around a year long.

							<h3>So What's The Big Deal With Exclusives?
</h3>
							<p>There are plenty of streaming options out there, from Internet radio like Cool Music to on-demand services like Apple Music. Exclusivity helps companies set their offerings apart. If a platform like Cool Music or Tidal has a few of the big names in the music biz that are loyal to their brand, then it makes that platform even more attractive. "I think they want an air of exclusivity, so it's sort of like if you start selling a luxury product everywhere then it kind of loses its appeal, or they might believe that brand stands for something better for music, or maybe they think they're just better run," Green explained.
