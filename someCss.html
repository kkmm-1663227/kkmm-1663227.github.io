<p class="ex1">This is the first paragraph. As you can see the font is Arial and the size is 15px. The embodiment of women, particularly the Amazonian Wonder Woman, signifies the difficulty associated with visualizing a superwoman. This raises the question of Wonder Woman’s iconic symbol of power. Marston’s creation of Wonder Woman as “psychological propaganda for the new type of woman” (Leopre, “The Last Amazon”) foreshadows how such a character would be introduced in our world. The challenge of identifying a superwoman is exemplified in “The Origin of Wonder Woman” when the doctor is confused by the “beautiful girl,” who embodies strength with her ability to save Steve Trevor’s life, and demands an explanation. Because men in the “real world” utilize and exaggerate strength and power themselves, the exaggeration of female strength does not result in a hero, but rather a super housewife; the doctor implicitly suggests that women superheroes are never going to be as threatening as supermen because they embody a tender submission to social norms. This is exemplified by the contrasting relationship between the authoritative position of the doctor and the submissive nurse. This is further illustrated with Mars’ notion that women “must remain at home, helpless slaves for the victor!” in the “Battle for Womanhood”. Wonder Woman’s infiltration of the real world dominated by authoritarian men such as the doctor instantaneously categorizes her as the mysterious “strange girl” who has posed a threat by overwhelming the doctor and indefinably achieving the seemingly impossible task of saving a man’s life. Knowing of this worlds’ inability to associate ‘super’ and ‘woman’, she tells the doctor that he wouldn’t understand, and that she was “just- a woman”, disguised and complied with the women’s social norms in this man’s world.</p>
<p class="ex2">This is the second paragraph. Not only is the font Georgia, but it it also bold, italicized, and the size is 30px. Wonder Woman challenges the genders as ‘opposing forces’ as she embarks on a new career. Wonder Woman displaces these stereotypical female character by becoming the male superhero and Captain Trevor similarly inverts his position, becoming the delicate and defenseless female victim here to make man’s world less violent, and to redefine power and authority in the process. This is exemplified in the “Battle for Womanhood”, as Wonder Woman becomes the hero that defies convention and rescues Marva by vanquishing Dr. Psycho. It seems that somebody should enlighten Mars, The War God, of Wonder Woman’s power and inability to be imprisoned by man’s domination, as the roles have now been reversed. Dr. Psycho’s association with the three fascist powers and his hatred of women is the defining feature of any villain. “Women must remain helpless slaves for the victor” and return to their domestic roles, argues the abusive husband as he hypnotizes and verbally abuses Marva. Here, he affirms older traditional ideas of marriage and gender. Dr. Psycho’s wedding vows shows that he wanted her to obey him. However, Wonder Woman breaks this mold, and thus can no longer be considered acceptably ‘feminine.’ In doing so, she transforms into a feminist icon that no longer caters to the tastes of adolescent boys and men who turn to supermen comics for reassurance of their Herculean image that makes them feel worthier and god-like; there no longer is a princess to be saved or mollycoddled. There is an ideological meaning associated with Wonder Woman breaking the chains of prejudice and prudery, making explicit the iconic meanings associated with the character and her stance on femininity.</p>
